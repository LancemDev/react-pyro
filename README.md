## Pyrowatch Fire Detection system using YOLOv5, OpenCV, GSM, and Arduino

### Introduction

This project is a fire detection system that uses YOLOv5, OpenCV, GSM, and Arduino. The system is able to detect fire in real-time and send an SMS to the user. The system is also able to detect smoke and send an SMS to the relevant authorities i.e. Firefighting teams. Using an object detection model running on the device our system is able to identify fire and its class i.e. class A, B, C, D, and E and alert firefighting teams so that they are aware of the type of fire they are dealing with.


This repository contains the frontend code for the system. The frontend is a web application that allows the user to view the status of the system and also view the images captured by the system. The frontend is built using ReactJS and is hosted on Vercel.
